  description: "Information about alerts generated by the storage system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alerts are usually events that require attention from the system
  administrator. Most, although not all, alerts indicate that there is a problem
  with the storage system. For example, you might receive an alert telling you that
  a drive has faulted, or that the storage system is running out of space.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For information about configuring alerts, see the Help topics for the
  alertConfig and AlertConfigSNMPTarget resource types.

  @engdocs
  Holds a single AlertEvent info like Component id, Severity, Resolution ID,
  Description ID. As of now CLI does not use the Alert Indication. But going
  forward CLI can query the Alerts in the System instead of the Alert History.
  
  This object shows up in the GUI through BAM indication. The IndicationManager
  native provider processes any CIM_AlertIndication and converts them to
  BAM_Indication. We need to create an entirely new EMC_UIS_AlertEvent class in
  the new UIS OSLS provider - UIS_AlertServices which will send create
  indications to IndicationManager, which in turn will listen to
  CIM_CreateIndication instead of CIM_AlertIndication. External API can list the
  EMC_UIS_AlertEvent instances to get the list of Alerts in the system and can
  listen for CIM_InstCreation for EMC_UIS_AlertEvent for new Alerts generated. In
  KH we are planning to change native provider to query EMC_UIS_AlertEvents
  instead of EMC_AlertHistoryEntry objects to generate the list of Alerts in the
  system."

  computers running Microsoft Windows. Others vendors implementing SMB are Samba, MacOS.. 
  SMB was also known as Common Internet File System (CIFS).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An SMB server is created each time Windows shares are enabled on the NAS server. 
  An SMB server could be created as a standalone server or as a server that belongs to a 
  Windows domain (Active Directory). In that case, DNS must be enabled on the NAS server.

- name: dnsServer
  description: "Domain Name System (DNS) settings.
  <p/>
  A Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical system responsible for converting
  domain names to their corresponding IP addresses. The system uses DNS services
  to resolve network names and IP addresses for the network services it needs
  (for example, for NTP and SMTP servers), and to obtain IP addresses for hosts
  addressed by network names rather than IP addresses.
  <p/>
  During the initial system configuration process you must specify the network
  address of at least one DNS server for resolving hostnames to IP addresses.
  Later, you can add, delete, or change DNS server settings.
  <p/>
  You can configure multiple DNS server domains to specify each domain and IP
  address of the DNS servers for the system to use. By default, the system uses
  the top entry in the list as the current DNS server. The remaining list
  provides a hierarchy of DNS servers to use if the first-choice server becomes
  unavailable. If the first DNS server in the list becomes unavailable, the
  system proceeds to the next DNS server in the list, and so on. You can also
  specify default DNS server addresses to indicate which addresses the system
  will use first.
  <p/>
  DNS server addresses are grouped under DNS server domains. Each domain is
  identified by a domain identifier.
  <p/>
  <b>Important:</b> You must configure at least one valid DNS server entry in
  the domain for the system. Deleting the last DNS server entry can disrupt
  network communication to the device, and potentially interrupt
  communication between the system and the hosts that use its storage resources."

  description: "Information about the EMC Remote Support (ESRS) configuration<br/>
  <br/>
  Unity Remote Support is enabled with the EMC&#8217;s leading remote 
  support platform: EMC Secure Remote Support (ESRS). ESRS is a remote 
  monitoring and support 
  feature that provides authorized personnel with EMC remote access capabilities 
  to storage systems via a secure and encrypted tunnel. The secure 
  tunnel that ESRS establishes between the storage system and 
  systems on the EMC network can be used to transfer files out 
  to the storage system or back to EMC.<br/>
  <br/>
  ESRS provides the following features in providing an end-to-end 
  remote support solution:<br/>
  <br/>
  <ul>
  <li>Automation - IP based connection enables fast remote diagnosis 
  and repair of potential problems before an impact to business 
  operations is noticed.</li>
  <li>Authentication - Advanced security features such as AES 256-bit 
  encryption and RSA digital certificates ensure data privacy.</li>
  <li>Authorization - Customizable policies that you control include 
  the ability to allow or deny remote support sessions.</li>
  <li>Audit - Detailed audit capabilities enable compliance with regulatory 
  and internal business requirements.</li>
  </ul>
  <br/>
  ESRS offers two remote support solutions:<br/>
  <ul>
  <li>Integrated solution, which uses ESRS Virtual Edition (ESRS V3) technology integrated 
  into the storage system to connect with EMC</li>
  <li>Centralized solution, which uses the ESRS Virtual Edition 
  (ESRS V3) to connect with EMC</li>
  </ul>
  <br/>
  Setting up Remote Support requires:
  <br/>
  <ul>
  <li>An installed EMC Support license</li>
  <li>Valid support credentials</li>
  <li>A configured DNS server</li>
  </ul>
  <br/>
  For information about ESRS components and setup, go to the 
  support website.<br/>
  Note that all proxy configuration for integrated support is now available from the supportProxy 
  object. These properties proxyIsEnabled,proxyStatus,proxyAddress,proxyIsHTTP,proxyUserName
   are deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

  Fail-Safe Network (FSN) is a high-availability feature that extends link failover into the

  MAC address and potentially multiple IP addresses. An FSN can be built from Ethernet Ports and
  non-FSN link aggregations, or combination of them. Only one connection in an FSN is active
  at a time. Port with active connection is the Active Port. Unity always uses the primary connection,
  if available. Port with primary connection is the Primary Port. If the primary connection fails,
  Unity automatically switches to one of the standby connections. When the primary connection is
  available again, an FSN automatically switches back to the primary connection.
  <p/>
  <b>Note: </b>If you want to include either Ethernet Ports or link aggregations in an FSN Port,

  description: "(Applies if link aggregation is supported.) Ethernet port link aggregation settings.
  <p/>
  Link aggregation lets you link Ethernet ports (for example, port 0 and port 1)

  use up to four Ethernet ports on the SP. If your system has two SPs, and you
  link two physical ports, the same ports on both SPs are linked for redundancy.
  For example, if you link port 0 to port 1, the system creates one link
  aggregation for these ports on SPA and another link aggregation on SPB.
  <p/>
  <b>Note: </b>You can aggregate only Ethernet ports belonging to the same I/O module
  or on-board Ethernet ports. Aggregation of ports from different I/O modules is not allowed.

  <b>Note: </b>You can aggregate only Ethernet ports with the same MTU size.
  <p/>
  <b>Note: </b>You can not add an Ethernet port to aggregation if there are iSCSI portals on it.

  Link aggregation provides the following advantages:
  <ul>
  <li>Increases overall throughput, since two physical ports are linked into one

  <li>Provides basic load balancing across linked ports, since the network
  traffic is distributed across multiple physical ports.</li>
  <li>Provides redundant ports so that if one port in a linked pair fails, the
  system does not lose connectivity.</li>
  </ul>
  <b>Note: </b>With link aggregation, both linked ports must be connected to the
  same switch, and the switch must be configured to use the link aggregation that
  uses the Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP). The documentation that came

  NAS Servers are software components used to transfer data and provide the connection ports

  NAS servers are independent from each other.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  NAS Servers access data on available drives making it available to network hosts

  Storage system supports NAS Servers for managing file-level storage resources, 
  such as VMware NFS datastores or file systems. 
  <br/>
  Before you can provision a file-level storage resource, a NAS Server must be created with 
  the necessary sharing protocols enabled. When NAS Servers are created, 
  you can specify the storage pool and owning SP - either SPA or SPB.
  <br/>
  In the storage systems, NAS Servers can leverage the Link Aggregation functionality to 
  create a highly available environment. Once a link aggregated port group is available, 
  you create or modify NAS Server network interfaces to leverage the available port group.  
  Because NAS Servers are accessible through only one SP at a time, they will fail over to 
  the other SP when there is an SP failure event."

  The system relies on NTP as a standard for synchronizing the system clock with

  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some applications will not operate correctly if the clock on the system is not

  <ul>
  <li>
  Minimizes the chance that synchronization issues will arise between the system

  Reduces the difficulty of reconciling timestamps used for log information in

  <br/>
  You can use Quick Start mode to create system recommended pools based on the
  type and availability of drives in the system. In Quick Start mode, the system
  recommends separate pools for different drive types and uses default RAID
  configurations for the drives. A pool configured in Quick Start mode has only
  one tier.
  <br/>

  Quick Start mode is available when both of these conditions are met:
  <ul>
  <li>No pools exist on the system.</li>
  <li>The system is not licensed for FAST VP or FAST Cache.</li>
  </ul>
  <br/>
  To create pools using Quick Start mode, follow these steps:

  <p/>
  The preferred interfaces for IPv4 and IPv6 are independent from each other. During the replication, the production interfaces
  could be activated and deactivated automatically, so the separate preferred interface settings are required for production and
  backup & DR testing interfaces. For each NAS server, the following preferred interface settings exist:
  <ol>
      <li>Production interfaces, IPv4.</li>
      <li>Production interfaces, IPv6.</li>
      <li>Backup & DR testing interfaces, IPv4.</li>
      <li>Backup & DR testing interfaces, IPv6.</li>
  </ol>
  <p/>
  Each of these settings could be set to the explicit interface. If it isn't set, corresponding interface will be selected automatically.
  <p/>
  The acting preferred interfaces, one for IPv4 and one for IPv6, are selected among active interfaces by the following rules, ordered by priority (highest first):
  <ol>
      <li>Manually selected interfaces have priority over automatically selected ones.</li>
      <li>Production interfaces have priority over backup and DR testing ones.</li>
      <li>The interface with the default gateway has priority over one not having one.</li>
      <li>From the otherwise equal priority interfaces, one with the most routes has the priority.</li>
      <li>From the otherwise equal priority interfaces, one with the minimal value of IP address (Sic!) has the priority.</li>

  <p/>
  <b>Note: </b>During the replication, on the destination side, only Backup & DR testing interfaces could be active.
  <p/>
  For the automatic selection, the interface re-selected each time any of this NAS interfaces or routes are changed.
  If the interface has been explicitly selected as preferred and then deleted, this type/class group setting
  (e.g. 'Production/IPv6') gets reset to automatic selection.
  <p/>
  During the replication, on the destination side, only the production interfaces settings could be overridden.
  It is controlled by the single flag both for IPv4 and IPv6 interfaces. Note that this flag is independent from
  the 'override' flag of the interface itself. If an interface is explicitly selected as preferred and then overridden,
  the interface is kept preferred.
  <p/>
  The acting preferred interfaces are marked by the corresponding property value, fileInterface.isPreferred == true.

  and periodically updates the copy, keeping it consistent with the source
  data. Replication provides an enhanced level of redundancy in case

  description: "All the system level security settings.
 <br/>
 Use this resource to enable and disable system level security settings. 
 <br/>
 The settings include:
 <br/>
 <br/>
 a) FIPS 140-2
 <br/>
  Information about whether the system is working in Federal Information
  Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2 mode.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The storage systems support FIPS 140-2 mode for the RSA BSAFE SSL modules on the
  storage pocessor that handle client management traffic. Management
  communication into and out of the system is encrypted using SSL. As a part of
  this process, the client and the Storage Management Server negotiate a cipher
  suite to use in the exchange. The use of FIPS 140-2 mode restricts the
  allowable set of cipher suites that can be selected in the negotiation
  to those that are sufficiently strong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If FIPS 140-2 mode is enabled, you may find that some of your existing clients
  can no longer communicate with the management ports of the array if they do not
  support a cipher suite of acceptable strength.

  <br/>
  <br/>
 b) SSO 
  <br/>
  Information about whether the system is participating in Single Sign On mode.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Single Sign On (SSO) mode, Unisphere Central (UC) becomes the authentication 
  server for multiple storage system, thus creating a shared authentication domain 
  where cross-array operations can be performed without re-entering user credentials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If SSO is enabled, the system will participate in Single Sign On mode,
  and authenticate against Unisphere Central previously configured on this array.

  <br/>
  <br/>
 c) TLS Mode
  <br/>
  Information about which TLS protocol versions the Storage Management Server allows for TLS communication.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Management communication into and out of the Storage Management Server is encrypted using TLS.
  As a part of this process, the client and the Storage Management Server negotiate a TLS protocol version to use.
  By default, the Storage Management Server supports TLSv1.0, TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 protocols for TLS communications.
 TLS Mode tls1_0 means that the Storage Management Server will support TLSv1.0, TLSv1.1, and TLSv1.2 protocols.
 TLS Mode tls1_1 means that the Storage Management Server will only support TLS communications using the TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 protocols and TLSv1.0 will not be considered a valid protocol.
 TLS Mode tls1_2 means that the Storage Management Server will only support TLS communications using the TLSv1.2 protocol. TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1 will not be considered valid protocols.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Disabling TLSv1.0 may impact existing client applications which are not compatible with TLSv1.1 or TLSv1.2 protocols. Similarly, disabling TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1 may impact existing client applications which are not compatible with TLSv1.2 protocol.
  In these cases, TLSv1.0 and/or TLSv1.1 support should remain enabled. Please refer to the security configuration guide for backward compatibility.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  NOTE: The modification of the supported TLS protocol versions for the NAS server is handled separately. Please use the svc_nas service script to configure the 
  supported TLS protocol versions for the NAS server."

  Storage replication is a process in which storage data is duplicated either

  Replication produces a read-only, point-in-time copy of source storage data
  and periodically updates the copy,
  keeping it consistent with the source data. Storage replication provides an
  enhanced level of redundancy in case
  the main storage backup system fails. As a result, the:
  <ul>
  <li>Downtime associated cost of a system failure is minimized.
  <li>Recovery process from a natural or human-caused disaster is facilitated.
  </ul>
  A replication session establishes an end-to-end path for a
  replication operation between a source and
  destination. The replication source and destination may be remote or local.
  The session establishes the path that
  the data follows as it moves from source to destination."

 On the storage array, it corresponds to a NAS server group with an independent IP addressing.
 At the moment, iSCSI and management resources do not support multi-tenant access. 

 For each tenant a corresponding Linux network namespace is created. In the current design, 
 traffic separation between the tenants is done by the VLANs. Each tenant reserves a group of VLANs,
 and each VLAN can belong to one tenant maximum. Every tenant gets a name and the Universally Unique Identifier (UUID).
 The UUID cannot be changed during the tenant life cycle. The asynchronous replication of the NAS servers
 is allowed only between the servers belonging to the tenants with the same UUID. 

 The NAS servers and VLANs can still belong to no tenant. Such NAS servers and VLANs operate
 in the Linux base network namespace, together with management and iSCSI interfaces. 

 The control stack of the system does not allow user to log in in the tenant administrator role.
 All the tenants, NAS servers and VLANs are managed from the single system administrator account.
 To allow this, the corresponding GUI and CLI modifications are made."

  Preserve recreates one prior async replication from the original source. Preserve tries to find the
  prior async session on the destination remote system identified by the remoteSystem parameter, 
  and if successful, removes the existing session, creates a new async session to the remote system, 
  and starts the replication process. If there is a common base snap available, then that will be used
  to optimize the initial copy.

  Preserve requires that the original async sessions are in the hibernated state. It also requires that 
  there is not already an async replication from the local nas_server to the remote system."

  Holds a single AlertEvent info like Component id, Severity, Resolution ID,
  Description ID. As of now CLI does not use the Alert Indication. But going
  forward CLI can query the Alerts in the System instead of the Alert History.
  
  This object shows up in the GUI through BAM indication. The IndicationManager
  native provider processes any CIM_AlertIndication and converts them to
  BAM_Indication. We need to create an entirely new EMC_UIS_AlertEvent class in
  the new UIS OSLS provider - UIS_AlertServices which will send create
  indications to IndicationManager, which in turn will listen to
  CIM_CreateIndication instead of CIM_AlertIndication. External API can list the
  EMC_UIS_AlertEvent instances to get the list of Alerts in the system and can
  listen for CIM_InstCreation for EMC_UIS_AlertEvent for new Alerts generated. In
  KH we are planning to change native provider to query EMC_UIS_AlertEvents
  instead of EMC_AlertHistoryEntry objects to generate the list of Alerts in the

    description: "Domain Name System (DNS) settings.
  <p/>
  A Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical system responsible for converting
  domain names to their corresponding IP addresses. The system uses DNS services
  to resolve network names and IP addresses for the network services it needs
  (for example, for NTP and SMTP servers), and to obtain IP addresses for hosts
  addressed by network names rather than IP addresses.
  <p/>
  During the initial system configuration process you must specify the network
  address of at least one DNS server for resolving hostnames to IP addresses.
  Later, you can add, delete, or change DNS server settings.
  <p/>
  You can configure multiple DNS server domains to specify each domain and IP
  address of the DNS servers for the system to use. By default, the system uses
  the top entry in the list as the current DNS server. The remaining list
  provides a hierarchy of DNS servers to use if the first-choice server becomes
  unavailable. If the first DNS server in the list becomes unavailable, the
  system proceeds to the next DNS server in the list, and so on. You can also
  specify default DNS server addresses to indicate which addresses the system
  will use first.
  <p/>
  DNS server addresses are grouped under DNS server domains. Each domain is
  identified by a domain identifier.
  <p/>
  <b>Important:</b> You must configure at least one valid DNS server entry in
  the domain for the system. Deleting the last DNS server entry can disrupt
  network communication to the device, and potentially interrupt
  communication between the system and the hosts that use its storage resources."

    description: "Information about the EMC Remote Support (ESRS) configuration<br/>
  <br/>
  Unity Remote Support is enabled with the EMC&#8217;s leading remote 
  support platform: EMC Secure Remote Support (ESRS). ESRS is a remote 
  monitoring and support 
  feature that provides authorized personnel with EMC remote access capabilities 
  to storage systems via a secure and encrypted tunnel. The secure 
  tunnel that ESRS establishes between the storage system and 
  systems on the EMC network can be used to transfer files out 
  to the storage system or back to EMC.<br/>
  <br/>
  ESRS provides the following features in providing an end-to-end 
  remote support solution:<br/>
  <br/>
  <ul>
  <li>Automation - IP based connection enables fast remote diagnosis 
  and repair of potential problems before an impact to business 
  operations is noticed.</li>
  <li>Authentication - Advanced security features such as AES 256-bit 
  encryption and RSA digital certificates ensure data privacy.</li>
  <li>Authorization - Customizable policies that you control include 
  the ability to allow or deny remote support sessions.</li>
  <li>Audit - Detailed audit capabilities enable compliance with regulatory 
  and internal business requirements.</li>
  </ul>
  <br/>
  ESRS offers two remote support solutions:<br/>
  <ul>
  <li>Integrated solution, which uses ESRS Virtual Edition (ESRS V3) technology integrated 
  into the storage system to connect with EMC</li>
  <li>Centralized solution, which uses the ESRS Virtual Edition 
  (ESRS V3) to connect with EMC</li>
  </ul>
  <br/>
  Setting up Remote Support requires:
  <br/>
  <ul>
  <li>An installed EMC Support license</li>
  <li>Valid support credentials</li>
  <li>A configured DNS server</li>
  </ul>
  <br/>
  For information about ESRS components and setup, go to the 
  support website.<br/>
  Note that all proxy configuration for integrated support is now available from the supportProxy 
  object. These properties proxyIsEnabled,proxyStatus,proxyAddress,proxyIsHTTP,proxyUserName
   are deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

  <b>Series operations need to perform to enable Integrated Remote Support</b><br/>
  <br/>
  Step 1: Accept EULA. The EULA must be accepted before any other configurations.
  <div class='examplebox'>
  <p>
  POST /api/instances/esrsParam/0/action/modify <br/>
  { <br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;isEsrsVeEulaAccepted&quot; : &quot;true&quot;<br/>
  }<br/>
  </p>
  </div>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Step 2: Update contact infomation in systemInformation object. EMC will use this information to contact end user when errors detected.
  <div class='examplebox'>
  <p>
  POST /api/instances/systemInformation/0/action/modify <br/>
  { <br/>

  }<br/>
  </p>
  </div>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Step 3: Set proxy server if the user wants to configure Integrated Remote Support with a proxy server. This step can be skipped if user doesn't want to use proxy server. 
  <div class='examplebox'>
  <p>
  POST /api/instances/supportProxy/0/action/modify <br/>
  { <br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;isEnabled&quot; : &quot;true&quot;,<br/>

  }<br/>
  </p>
  </div>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Step 4: Validate Network connectivity between Integrated Remote Support client and EMC servers.
  <div class='examplebox'>
  <p>
  POST /api/instances/esrsParam/0/action/checkNetwork <br/>
  { <br/>
  }<br/>
  </p>
  </div>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Following steps are try to get the available sites for the current system, select the correct one and set it into Integrated Remote Support client.<br/>
  Step 5: Request for an access code. This access code will be used later to get the available sites.
  <div class='examplebox'>
  <p>
  POST /api/instances/esrsParam/0/action/requestAccessCode <br/>
  { <br/>
  }<br/>
  </p>
  </div>

  <br/>
  Step 6: Validate the access code.
  <div class='examplebox'>
  <p>
  POST /api/instances/esrsParam/0/action/validateAccessCode <br/>
  { <br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;accessCode&quot; : &quot;243857&quot;<br/>
  }<br/>
  </p>
  </div>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Step 7: Set siteId. Select the correct site id from the returned sites in previous request.
  <div class='examplebox'>
  <p>
  POST /api/instances/esrsParam/0/action/modify <br/>
  { <br/>

  Storage systems support NDMP v2-v4 over the network. Direct-attach NDMP is not supported. 
  This means that the tape drives need to be connected to a media server, and the NAS server 
  communicates with the media server over the network. NDMP has an advantage when using 
  multiprotocol file systems because it backs up the Windows ACLs as well as the UNIX security 
  information."

  In a GUI it is available on General Settings - 'Link aggregation & FSN' page.
  <p/>
  Fail-Safe Network (FSN) is a high-availability feature that extends link failover into the
  network by providing a switch-level redundancy. An FSN appears as a single link with a single
  MAC address and potentially multiple IP addresses. An FSN can be built from Ethernet Ports and
  non-FSN link aggregations, or combination of them. Only one connection in an FSN is active
  at a time. Port with active connection is the Active Port. Unity always uses the primary connection,
  if available. Port with primary connection is the Primary Port. If the primary connection fails,
  Unity automatically switches to one of the standby connections. When the primary connection is
  available again, an FSN automatically switches back to the primary connection.
  <p/>
  <b>Note: </b>If you want to include either Ethernet Ports or link aggregations in an FSN Port,
  configure them before creating an FSN.
  <p/>
  <b>Note: </b>You can aggregate only Ethernet Ports and link aggregations with the same MTU size
  and not included in another FSN Port.
  <p/>
  <b>Note: </b>You can not add an Ethernet Port to FSN if there are iSCSI portals on it.
  <p/>
  The features of an FSN Port are as follows:
  <ul>
  <li>FSN component devices do not have to be the same device type. A single FSN Port
  can include Fast Ethernet devices or link aggregations, or a combination of these types,
  all on the same Unity.</li>
  <li>There can be a maximum of four devices in a FSN.</li>
  <li>Only one component device of an FSN Port is active at a time.</li>
  <li>If all the connections in FSN Port fail, the link is down.</li>
  </ul>
  <p/>

  You can configure one FTP server and one SFTP server per NAS server. 
  File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a standard network protocol used to transfer 
  files from one host to another host over a TCP-based network, such as the Internet. 
  For secure transmission that encrypts the username, password, and content, FTP is secured 
  with SSH (SFTP). 
  <br/>
  <br/>
  You can activate an FTP server and SFTP server independently on each NAS server.
  The FTP and SFTP clients are authenticated using credentials defined on a Unix name
  server (such as an NIS server or a LDAP server) or a Windows domain. 
  Windows user names need to be entered using the 'username@domain' or
  'domain\\username' formats.
  Each FTP and SFTP must have a home directory defined in the name server that
  must be accessible on the NAS server. 
  FTP allows also clients to connect as anonymous users."

  <b>Note: </b>You can not add an Ethernet port to aggregation if there are iSCSI portals on it.
  <p/>
  Link aggregation provides the following advantages:
  <ul>
  <li>Increases overall throughput, since two physical ports are linked into one
  logical port.</li>
  <li>Provides basic load balancing across linked ports, since the network
  traffic is distributed across multiple physical ports.</li>
  <li>Provides redundant ports so that if one port in a linked pair fails, the
  system does not lose connectivity.</li>
  </ul>
  <b>Note: </b>With link aggregation, both linked ports must be connected to the
  same switch, and the switch must be configured to use the link aggregation that
  uses the Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP). The documentation that came
  with your switch should provide more information about using LACP.
  <p/>
  The Unisphere online Help provides more details on cabling the SPs to the
  Disk-Array Enclosures (DAEs)."

  For both historical and real-time quey, the following URI pattern can be used to retrieve stat paths for a group of
  metrics. In this pattern, %25 is an encoded value for a percent sign (%).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <span class=EMCCode>/api/types/metric/instances?compact=true&filter=path
  lk <i>metric-path</i>.%25</span>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  where <i>metric-path</i> is one of the stat paths listed below:
  <ul>
  <li>sp.*.blockCache - Counters for cache metrics</li>
  <li>sp*.cifs - CIFS protocol statistics</li>
  <li>sp.*.fibreChannel - Fibre Channel statistics</li>
  <li>sp.*.fs - File system statistics</li>
  <li>sp.*.ftp - FTP protocol statistics</li>
  <li>sp.*.http - HTTP protocol statistics</li>
  <li>sp.*.iscsi -  iSCSI protocol statistics</li>
  <li>sp.*.memory - Memory statistics</li>
  <li>sp.*.ndmp - NDMP protocal statistics</li>
  <li>sp.*.cpu - CPU statistics</li>
  <li>sp.*.net - Network interface and protocol statistics</li>
  <li>sp.*.nfs - NFS protocol statistics</li>
  <li>sp.*.ntp - NTP statistics</li>
  <li>sp.*.physical - Physical device statistics</li>
  <li>sp.*.replication - Replication statistics</li>
  <li>sp.*.rpc -  RPC statistics</li>
  <li>sp.*.ssh - SSH statistics</li>
  <li>sp.*.store - Storage hardware interface statistics</li>
  <li>sp.*.storage - Storage statistics</li>
  <li>sp.*.vhdx - Microsoft Hyper-V virtual disks statistics</li>
  <li>sp.*.virusChecker - Virus checker statistics</li>
  </ul>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For example, to retrieve a list of available network performance metrics, you
  can use the following GET collection request:

  <br>For Unisphere Central, this API requires a ?filter= URL parameter that filters on at least<u>storageSystem.id</u>(Unisphere Central only) and <u>path</u>.
  <br>The storageSystem.id must be filtered on Unisphere Central to an individual system (storageSystem.id eq <desired storageSystem id>),
  and the path must be filtered to one or more paths.
  <br><u>An example of a valid filter(s) for Unisphere Central:</u>

  A customer environment is often ever-changing, and as a result the ability to 
  deliver business continuity and flexibility is paramount. The new local LUN migration 
  feature address this concern, by adding the ability to move LUNs and Consistency Groups 
  between Pools on a system. Local LUN migration can be used to rebalance storage resources 
  across Pools when customer activity changes and an individual Pool's usage becomes oversaturated. 
  Another use case for local LUN migration is to provide LUNs with a destination when a Pool is 
  to be decommissioned. By leveraging Unity's Transparent Data Transfer (TDX) engine, host access 
  remains fully online during the migration session."

  NAS Servers are software components used to transfer data and provide the connection ports 
  for hosts to access file-level storage resources.
  NAS servers are independent from each other.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  NAS Servers access data on available drives making it available to network hosts
  via specific protocols (NFS/SMB/FTP/SFTP).
  Storage system supports NAS Servers for managing file-level storage resources, 
  such as VMware NFS datastores or file systems. 
  <br/>
  Before you can provision a file-level storage resource, a NAS Server must be created with 
  the necessary sharing protocols enabled. When NAS Servers are created, 
  you can specify the storage pool and owning SP - either SPA or SPB.
  <br/>
  In the storage systems, NAS Servers can leverage the Link Aggregation functionality to 
  create a highly available environment. Once a link aggregated port group is available, 
  you create or modify NAS Server network interfaces to leverage the available port group.  
  Because NAS Servers are accessible through only one SP at a time, they will fail over to 
  the other SP when there is an SP failure event."

  Some applications will not operate correctly if the clock on the system is not

  connected hosts to use the same time server. Doing so does the following:
  <ul>
  <li>
  Minimizes the chance that synchronization issues will arise between the system
  and connected hosts.
  </li>
  <li>
  Reduces the difficulty of reconciling timestamps used for log information in
  the different systems.
  </li>
  </ul>
  <b>Note:</b><b> </b>When using a NAS server for CIFS network shares, the
  system cannot access an Active Directory domain unless the system is
  synchronized within five minutes of the Active Directory controller for the
  domain where the network shares reside.

  <b>Creating pools using Quick Start mode</b>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  You can use Quick Start mode to create system recommended pools based on the
  type and availability of drives in the system. In Quick Start mode, the system
  recommends separate pools for different drive types and uses default RAID
  configurations for the drives. A pool configured in Quick Start mode has only
  one tier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Quick Start mode is available when both of these conditions are met:
  <ul>
  <li>No pools exist on the system.</li>
  <li>The system is not licensed for FAST VP or FAST Cache.</li>
  </ul>
  <br/>
  To create pools using Quick Start mode, follow these steps:
  <ol>
  <li>Run POST <font
  color=#0f0f0f>api/types/pool/action/recommendAutoConfiguration. </font>
  <font color=#0f0f0f><br/></font>
  <font color=#0f0f0f><br/></font>
  <font color=#0f0f0f>The response body contains a set of poolSetting
  instances.</li></font>
  <font color=#0f0f0f><br/></font>
  <font color=#0f0f0f><li value=2>For each poolSetting instance returned
  in Step 1, run POST /api/types/pool/instances with the following arguments,
  using values obtained from the poolSetting instance:</li></font>
  <ul>
  <li>addRaidGroupParameters : [{dskGroup : poolSetting.storageConfiguration.possibleStorageConfigurations.diskGroup,</li>
  <li>numDisks : poolSetting.storageConfiguration.possibleStorageConfigurations.raidGroupConfigurations.diskCount,</li>
  <li>raidType : poolSetting.storageConfiguration.raidType,</li>
  <li>stripeWidth : poolSetting.storageConfiguration.possibleStorageConfigurations.raidGroupConfigurations.stripeWidths},...]</li>
  </ul>

  The non-local connections are those which hosts can be accessed from this NAS server interfaces only via some router (gateway).
  <p/>
  The preferred interfaces for IPv4 and IPv6 are independent from each other. During the replication, the production interfaces
  could be activated and deactivated automatically, so the separate preferred interface settings are required for production and
  backup & DR testing interfaces. For each NAS server, the following preferred interface settings exist:
  <ol>
      <li>Production interfaces, IPv4.</li>
      <li>Production interfaces, IPv6.</li>
      <li>Backup & DR testing interfaces, IPv4.</li>
      <li>Backup & DR testing interfaces, IPv6.</li>
  </ol>
  <p/>
  Each of these settings could be set to the explicit interface. If it isn't set, corresponding interface will be selected automatically.
  <p/>
  The acting preferred interfaces, one for IPv4 and one for IPv6, are selected among active interfaces by the following rules, ordered by priority (highest first):
  <ol>
      <li>Manually selected interfaces have priority over automatically selected ones.</li>
      <li>Production interfaces have priority over backup and DR testing ones.</li>
      <li>The interface with the default gateway has priority over one not having one.</li>
      <li>From the otherwise equal priority interfaces, one with the most routes has the priority.</li>
      <li>From the otherwise equal priority interfaces, one with the minimal value of IP address (Sic!) has the priority.</li>
  </ol>
  <p/>
  <b>Note: </b>During the replication, on the destination side, only Backup & DR testing interfaces could be active.
  <p/>
  For the automatic selection, the interface re-selected each time any of this NAS interfaces or routes are changed.
  If the interface has been explicitly selected as preferred and then deleted, this type/class group setting
  (e.g. 'Production/IPv6') gets reset to automatic selection.
  <p/>
  During the replication, on the destination side, only the production interfaces settings could be overridden.
  It is controlled by the single flag both for IPv4 and IPv6 interfaces. Note that this flag is independent from
  the 'override' flag of the interface itself. If an interface is explicitly selected as preferred and then overridden,
  the interface is kept preferred.

  The acting preferred interfaces are marked by the corresponding property value, fileInterface.isPreferred == true.

  Replication is a process in which storage data is duplicated either

  Replication produces a read-only, point-in-time copy of source data

  data. Replication provides an enhanced level of redundancy in case
  the main storage backup system fails. As a result, the:
  <ul>
  <li>Downtime associated cost of a system failure is minimized.
  <li>Recovery process from a natural or human-caused disaster is facilitated.

 <br/>
 Use this resource to enable and disable system level security settings. 
 <br/>
 The settings include:
 <br/>
 <br/>
 a) FIPS 140-2
 <br/>
  Information about whether the system is working in Federal Information
  Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2 mode.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The storage systems support FIPS 140-2 mode for the RSA BSAFE SSL modules on the
  storage pocessor that handle client management traffic. Management
  communication into and out of the system is encrypted using SSL. As a part of
  this process, the client and the Storage Management Server negotiate a cipher
  suite to use in the exchange. The use of FIPS 140-2 mode restricts the
  allowable set of cipher suites that can be selected in the negotiation
  to those that are sufficiently strong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If FIPS 140-2 mode is enabled, you may find that some of your existing clients
  can no longer communicate with the management ports of the array if they do not
  support a cipher suite of acceptable strength.

  <br/>
  <br/>
 b) SSO 
  <br/>
  Information about whether the system is participating in Single Sign On mode.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Single Sign On (SSO) mode, Unisphere Central (UC) becomes the authentication 
  server for multiple storage system, thus creating a shared authentication domain 
  where cross-array operations can be performed without re-entering user credentials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If SSO is enabled, the system will participate in Single Sign On mode,
  and authenticate against Unisphere Central previously configured on this array.

  <br/>
  <br/>
 c) TLS Mode
  <br/>
  Information about which TLS protocol versions the Storage Management Server allows for TLS communication.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Management communication into and out of the Storage Management Server is encrypted using TLS.
  As a part of this process, the client and the Storage Management Server negotiate a TLS protocol version to use.
  By default, the Storage Management Server supports TLSv1.0, TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 protocols for TLS communications.
 TLS Mode tls1_0 means that the Storage Management Server will support TLSv1.0, TLSv1.1, and TLSv1.2 protocols.
 TLS Mode tls1_1 means that the Storage Management Server will only support TLS communications using the TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 protocols and TLSv1.0 will not be considered a valid protocol.
 TLS Mode tls1_2 means that the Storage Management Server will only support TLS communications using the TLSv1.2 protocol. TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1 will not be considered valid protocols.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Disabling TLSv1.0 may impact existing client applications which are not compatible with TLSv1.1 or TLSv1.2 protocols. Similarly, disabling TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1 may impact existing client applications which are not compatible with TLSv1.2 protocol.
  In these cases, TLSv1.0 and/or TLSv1.1 support should remain enabled. Please refer to the security configuration guide for backward compatibility.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  NOTE: The modification of the supported TLS protocol versions for the NAS server is handled separately. Please use the svc_nas service script to configure the 
  supported TLS protocol versions for the NAS server."

  Storage replication is a process in which storage data is duplicated either
  locally or to a remote network device.
  Replication produces a read-only, point-in-time copy of source storage data
  and periodically updates the copy,
  keeping it consistent with the source data. Storage replication provides an
  enhanced level of redundancy in case
  the main storage backup system fails. As a result, the:
  <ul>
  <li>Downtime associated cost of a system failure is minimized.
  <li>Recovery process from a natural or human-caused disaster is facilitated.
  </ul>
  A replication session establishes an end-to-end path for a
  replication operation between a source and
  destination. The replication source and destination may be remote or local.

 and gets the independent and exclusive access to certain storage resources.
 On the storage array, it corresponds to a NAS server group with an independent IP addressing.
 At the moment, iSCSI and management resources do not support multi-tenant access. 

 For each tenant a corresponding Linux network namespace is created. In the current design, 
 traffic separation between the tenants is done by the VLANs. Each tenant reserves a group of VLANs,
 and each VLAN can belong to one tenant maximum. Every tenant gets a name and the Universally Unique Identifier (UUID).
 The UUID cannot be changed during the tenant life cycle. The asynchronous replication of the NAS servers
 is allowed only between the servers belonging to the tenants with the same UUID. 

 The NAS servers and VLANs can still belong to no tenant. Such NAS servers and VLANs operate
 in the Linux base network namespace, together with management and iSCSI interfaces. 

 The control stack of the system does not allow user to log in in the tenant administrator role.
 All the tenants, NAS servers and VLANs are managed from the single system administrator account.
 To allow this, the corresponding GUI and CLI modifications are made."

  The storage system supports third-party anti-virus servers that perform virus scans and

  a file, the NAS server invokes the anti-virus server to scan the file for known 
  viruses. During the scan any access to this file is blocked.
  If the file does not contain a virus, it is written to the file system. 
  If the file is infected, corrective action (fixed, removed or placed in quarantine) is taken as
  defined by the anti-virus server. 
  You can optionally set up the service to scan the file on read access based on last access of the file 
  compared to last update of the third-party anti-virus date.
